# Simple Movie Website

Movie site application that I developed without using a framework with only HTML CSS JS. I tried to use Ecmascript 4 or 5, one of the old standards of Javascript.

I took the data from the json file and converted it into Dom Elements that I created dynamically. In addition, the movies can be navigated in the menu and main component with the keyboard arrow keys. You can go to the details of the movie.
